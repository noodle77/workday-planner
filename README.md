# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

## Given I'm creating a schedule:

- When I open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar

- When I scroll down, I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours of 9am to 5pm

- When I view the time blocks for that day, each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future

- When I click into a time block, I can enter an event

- When I click the save button for that time block, the text for that event is saved in local storage

- When I refresh the page, the saved events persist
