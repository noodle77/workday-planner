# Work Day Schedule

## Description

This application was created to help a busy worker organize their work day ahead of time.

It allows the user to enter and save information into each time block, which will persist 
even when the window is closed.
It keeps track of where the user is in the course of their scheduled day by color coding
each time block to represent if it is in the past, present, or future, relative to the 
current time.
Finally, it keeps the time and date updated to the second at the top of the page, so the 
user never loses track of those critical pieces of information.
